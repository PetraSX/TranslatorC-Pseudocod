# TranslatorC-Pseudocod
An app made with C++ and SFML library that translate any code written in C++ to Pseudocode.

Because it's made from scratch, it has some bugs resulted after the implementation for COPY/PASTE and some other functions.

The textBOX is a string divided on a number of lines (when displayed)

I hope you like it <3, feel free to modify it.
